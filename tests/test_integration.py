    # 1. In a real test, you would import the actual agent

    # from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # 5. Run the agent's chat method
    # final_response = await agent.chat(user_prompt)

    # The assertions would depend on the live data at the time of the test.
    # You would check if the response contains the expected analysis based on the prompt.
