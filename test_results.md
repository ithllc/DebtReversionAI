# DebtReversionAI Test Results

This document tracks the results of the test suite execution for the DebtReversionAI project.

## Test Run 1

*   **Result:** 14 failed, 2 passed, 1 skipped
*   **Summary of Failures:**
    *   **Async Support:** 13 tests failed because the test environment was not configured to run `async` functions. The error was `Failed: async def functions are not natively supported.`
    *   **Manus Initialization:** `test_manus_browser_initialization` failed with `AssertionError: Expected 'ManusClient' to be called once. Called 0 times.`.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Install `pytest-asyncio` to add support for async tests.
    2.  Investigate and fix the Manus client initialization test.

## Test Run 2

*   **Result:** 12 failed, 4 passed, 1 skipped
*   **Summary of Failures:**
    *   **`test_edgar.py`:** The mock for `edgar.Company` was not called as expected.
    *   **`test_financial.py`:**
        *   A `_pickle.PicklingError` from `yfinance` related to cookie handling.
        *   An `IndexError` because `yfinance` returned an empty dataframe, causing an out-of-bounds error.
        *   Assertions failed because the pickling error message was propagated into the results.
    *   **`test_manus.py`:**
        *   The `ManusClient` was not initialized as expected.
        *   `openai.NotFoundError` indicates that the tests are attempting to make real API calls that are not being properly mocked.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Fix the `ManusClient` initialization test.
    2.  Fix the `edgar.Company` mock call.
    3.  Address the `yfinance` errors by disabling caching in tests and ensuring empty dataframes are handled.
    4.  Correct the mocking in `test_manus.py` to prevent live API calls.

## Test Run 3

*   **Result:** 5 failed, 5 passed, 1 skipped, 6 errors
*   **Summary of Failures & Errors:**
    *   **`test_financial.py` (Errors):** An `AttributeError` on `yfinance.cache.get_yh_cache_dir` indicates the patch target is wrong. The attempt to disable caching caused all financial tests to error out during setup.
    *   **`test_edgar.py` (Failures):** `AttributeError: module 'mcp_servers' has no attribute 'edgar_server'` suggests the patch path for `edgar.Company` is incorrect, likely due to import complexities.
    *   **`test_manus.py` (Failures):** `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'id'`. The mock for `asyncio.to_thread` was too simplistic, returning a string instead of an object with an `.id` attribute, breaking the downstream logic in `_run_task`.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Correct the `yfinance` test fixture to properly mock `yfinance` without causing setup errors.
    2.  Fix the `test_manus.py` mocks to correctly simulate the object returned by the Manus API client.
    3.  Fix the patch path in `test_edgar.py`.
    4.  Rerun all tests.
