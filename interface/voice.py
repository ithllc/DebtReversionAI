        # print("Listening...")
        # voice_input = await self.browser.listen()
        # print(f"You said: {voice_input}")
        # response_text = await self.agent.chat(voice_input)

        # await self.browser.speak(response_text)
        pass


# To be implemented based on further details of the Manus AI voice SDK.
